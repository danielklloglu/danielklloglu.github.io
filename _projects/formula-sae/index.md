title: Northwestern Formula Racing Projects
description: I worked on two big projects throughout my time in Northwestern Formula Racing. I designed and manufactured a pedal box consisting of a baseplate, gas pedal, brake pedal, throttle return springs, brake over-travel switch, and throttle sensors to accommodate the change from an ICE car to an EV. I ran topology optimization on the pedals to minimize weight while maintaining rigidity. I used a CNC mill and lathe to make the final part.I also designed and led the manufacturing of the rear hubs of the car. I ran calculations to determine the critical stresses that the hubs are going to take and included a bump factor. I ran FEA using the findings to minimize the weight of the hubs while keeping the factor of safety above 1.5.

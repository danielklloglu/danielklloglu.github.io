## Rear Hub Design
**Problem**  
The previous rear hubs were heavy and costly while needing to withstand high loads from braking, cornering, and drivetrain torque. The design also had to mount brake rotors, constrain axial motion, and meet manufacturing and regulation requirements.

**Solution**  
I fully redesigned the hubs, locking nuts, and hubcaps. I calculated critical stresses with bump factors, ran FEA to optimize geometry while maintaining a >1.5 safety factor, created detailed engineering drawings, and coordinated CNC machining and coating with external suppliers.

**Results**  
- 6% weight reduction  
- 17% cost savings
- Factor of Safety > 1.5
- Fully manufacturable and competition-ready

## Pedal Box Design
**Problem**  
Transitioning from ICE to EV required a new pedal box capable of reliable braking, precise throttle control, safety shutdown integration, and driver adjustability—while remaining lightweight and structurally sound.

**Solution**  
I designed and manufactured a full pedal box assembly (baseplate, gas/brake pedals, return springs, sensors, and brake over-travel killswitch). I ran FEA and topology optimization to remove unnecessary material while maintaining strength. I CNC-machined the pedals and baseplate, turned the throttle shaft on the lathe, and fully assembled and integrated the system into the car.

**Results**  
- Precise throttle response  
- Reliable braking with automatic shutdown on failure  
- Lightweight and competition-ready system

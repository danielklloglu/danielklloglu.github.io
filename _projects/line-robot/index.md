* Built an autonomous differential-drive robot to complete a 40-foot white-line track.
* Designed lightweight chassis with laser-cut & 3D printed parts.
* Tuned a PID control algorithm with nested current + position loops for smooth, fast lap performance.
* Used a simple low resolution camera (OV7670) to detect robot's position on track

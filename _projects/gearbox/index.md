**Method**: Employed gear train calculations, detailed force/stress analyses, material selection, and appropriate safety factor calculations to ensure 5 years of reliable operation with 99% reliability. Design decisions prioritized manufacturability, cost-effectiveness, stiffness, and ease of maintenance.

**Result:** By employing spur gears, optimizing shaft geometry, and selecting cylindrical roller bearings for their high radial load capacity, the system achieves a compact, reliable, and manufacturable solution that achieved a **transmission error of 0.21%**. Critical design criteria—including a minimum shaft diameter of 20 mm and safety factors exceeding 1.2 at key stress points—were carefully maintained to ensure long-term structural integrity.

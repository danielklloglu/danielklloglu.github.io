Our approach included the gear train design, detailed force and stress analyses, material selection, and appropriate safety factor calculations to ensure 5 years of reliable operation with 99% reliability. Design decisions prioritized manufacturability, cost-effectiveness, stiffness, and ease of maintenance.

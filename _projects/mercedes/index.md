### Jul 2024 â€“ Oct 2024

- Optimized ergonomics and manufacturability of user-interacting components via kinematic simulation.  
- Reduced stress concentrations by **40%** through FEA-driven redesign of sheet-metal parts.  
- Developed a low-cost die-cast flap system to support next-gen electric truck charging.  
- Coordinated simulation, prototyping, and manufacturing workflows with detailed GD&T drawings.  
- Achieved **21% cost reduction** and improved operator ergonomics with injection-molded part replacements.

### Jul 2024 â€“ Oct 2024
* Optimized ergonomics and manufacturability of the maintanace flap opening arc via kinematic simulation.  
* Reduced stress concentrations by 40% through FEA-driven redesign of load-bearing stamped sheet-metal parts.   
* Achieved 21% cost reduction and improved operator ergonomics with injection-molded part replacements.

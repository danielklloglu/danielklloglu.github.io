## Benchtop Buffer Dilution System
**Problem:** The company wanted to enter the benchtop scale medical systems market to attract smaller customers to their ecosystem.
<br>
**Solution:** Designed and built AKBAâ€™s first benchtop buffer-dilution system, creating a automated functional prototype for testing and client demos within a strict budget.
<br>
**Results:** Prototype demonstrates the company's products in trade shows and is cheap and compact enough for lab-scale customers have an entry level product

## Product Standardization â€“ Pressurized Vessel Line
**Problem**  
The pressurized-vessel product line relied on custom designs for each order, resulting in long lead times, inconsistent documentation, and increased manufacturing and procurement costs.

**Solution**  
Collected and analyzed critical parameters across past custom projects to create standardized configurations. Updated engineering drawings and BOMs using GD&T, corrected tolerances, refreshed legacy callouts, and clarified hardware specifications to improve manufacturability and procurement.
<br>
**Results**  
- Reduced cost and lead time through standardization  
- Clear, consistent drawings and BOMs  
- Streamlined assembly and sourcing with accurate hardware specs

## Task 1: Improving Maintenance Flap Ergonomics
**Problem:** The semitruckâ€™s maintenance flap required excessive operator reach, causing strain and inefficient servicing.  
**Solution:** Used kinematic simulations in Siemens NX to evaluate multiple joint configurations and identify an optimized linkage geometry.  
**Result:** Reduced operator reach distance by **25%**, improving ergonomics and maintenance accessibility.

## Task 2: Lowering Manufacturing Cost of Flap Components
**Problem:** The existing cast aluminum flap component was expensive and slow to manufacture.  
**Solution:** Redesigned the part using **injection-molded plastic**, selecting appropriate materials and validating stiffness and durability via simulation.  
**Result:** Cut manufacturing cost by **21%** while maintaining structural performance.

## Task 3: Increasing Fatigue Life of Sheet-Metal Component
**Problem:** A stamped sheet-metal component experienced high stress concentrations around rivet holes, leading to fatigue failures.  
**Solution:** Performed FEA to locate stress hot spots and reworked hole geometry to better distribute loads.  
**Result:** Reduced peak stress by **18%**, improving fatigue life and long-term reliability.

* Optimized ergonomics and manufacturability of the maintanace flap opening arc via kinematic simulation.  
* Reduced stress concentrations by 40% through FEA-driven redesign of load-bearing stamped sheet-metal parts.   
* Achieved 21% cost reduction and improved operator ergonomics with injection-molded part replacements.
